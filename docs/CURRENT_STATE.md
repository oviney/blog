# Current Migration State - January 1, 2026

## Summary
Jekyll blog migration from Cayman theme (Jekyll 3.x) to Minimal Mistakes (Jekyll 4.x) is **COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**! 🎉

The site is now live at https://www.viney.ca/ with the Minimal Mistakes theme.

## Final Deployment Status

### Deployment Timeline
1. **Initial Attempt** (commit 4ac21b9): Failed - missing head-custom.html include
2. **Second Attempt** (commit 2a51641): Failed - removed custom layouts but blog.html still referenced read-time.html
3. **Third Attempt** (commit 82c334d): Built successfully but pages still used `layout: default` (Cayman theme)
4. **Final Deployment** (commit 41477d8): ✅ **SUCCESS** - All pages migrated to Minimal Mistakes layouts

### Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed missing `read-time.html` include in blog.html
- ✅ Updated opendns post from `layout: post` to `layout: single`
- ✅ Migrated all pages from `layout: default` to appropriate Minimal Mistakes layouts:
  - index.md: `layout: splash` (home page with header overlay)
  - about.md, software-engineering.md, test-automation.md: `layout: single`
  - blog.html: `layout: single` with title "Blog Archive"
  - 404.html, _authors/ouray.md: `layout: single`

## Completed Work

## What Happens After VS Code Reload

1. **Reload VS Code**: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
2. **MCP Bridge Active**: Playwright tools will connect to authenticated Chrome
3. **Navigate to Settings**: Can automate via Copilot or manually
4. **Enable GitHub Actions**: Change Pages source setting
5. **Workflow Triggers**: GitHub Actions Run #1 will execute
6. **Deployment**: ~1-2 minutes to build and deploy
7. **Verification**: Check https://www.viney.ca/ for Minimal Mistakes theme

## Critical: One Manual Step Remaining

**Repository Settings Change Required:**

**Option 1 - Manual (30 seconds):**
1. Go to: https://github.com/oviney/blog/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source"
3. Change from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
4. Click "Save"

**Option 2 - Automated (via MCP Bridge after reload):**
1. Ask Copilot: "Navigate to repository settings and enable GitHub Actions"
2. MCP Bridge will use authenticated Chrome session
3. Copilot automates the click through browser

**Why this step is needed:**
- GitHub Actions workflow file exists and is pushed
- Workflow is queued (visible at https://github.com/oviney/blog/actions)
- But GitHub Pages still set to "Deploy from a branch" (old method)
- Changing to "GitHub Actions" unblocks the queued workflow
- Once unblocked, deployment happens automatically

## Verification Checklist

After GitHub Actions deployment completes:

- [ ] Navigate to https://www.viney.ca/
- [ ] Verify Minimal Mistakes theme appearance (not Cayman banner)
- [ ] Check author profile sidebar visible
- [ ] Open a post: https://www.viney.ca/2024/12/31/testing-times/
- [ ] Verify table of contents in right sidebar
- [ ] Verify social sharing buttons present
- [ ] Verify related posts section at bottom
- [ ] Verify reading time estimate displayed
- [ ] Check mobile responsive design
- [ ] Test search functionality (if available)

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise after deployment:

```bash
# Revert to Cayman theme
git checkout backup-cayman-theme -- Gemfile _config.yml _posts/
rm .github/workflows/jekyll.yml

# Push rollback
git add -A
git commit -m "rollback: revert to Cayman theme"
git push origin main

# Change GitHub Pages settings back to:
# Source: "Deploy from a branch"
# Branch: main, folder: / (root)
```

Backup branch exists: `backup-cayman-theme` (if we created it, otherwise current commit history allows revert)

## Environment Details

## Configuration Files to Preserve

If starting fresh, these are the critical files:

1. **`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`**
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "playwright": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--extension"]
       }
     },
     "inputs": []
   }
   ```

2. **`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`** (in repository)
3. **`Gemfile`** (in repository)
4. **`_config.yml`** (in repository)
5. **`.git/hooks/pre-commit`** (in repository)

## Next Actions (Immediate)

1. **Save this document** ✅ (you're reading it)
2. **Reload VS Code** → MCP Bridge will activate
3. **Enable GitHub Actions** → Via MCP or manually
4. **Monitor deployment** → https://github.com/oviney/blog/actions
5. **Verify production** → https://www.viney.ca/
6. **Close Issue #7** → https://github.com/oviney/blog/issues/7

## Success Criteria

Migration complete when:
- ✅ All commits pushed to main
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⏳ GitHub Actions enabled in settings
- ⏳ First successful GitHub Actions build
- ⏳ Minimal Mistakes theme visible on production
- ⏳ All theme features working (TOC, sharing, related posts)
- ⏳ Issue #7 closed with summary

**Current Status**: 5/7 complete (71%)

## Contact Points

- **Repository**: https://github.com/oviney/blog

- **Actions**: https://github.com/oviney/blog/actions
- **Settings**: https://github.com/oviney/blog/settings/pages
- **Issue**: https://github.com/oviney/blog/issues/7

## Notes

- Local `jekyll serve` still broken (SSL issue with remote themes) - this is expected and OK
- Pre-commit validation is sufficient for content changes
- GitHub Actions provides full build logs for debugging
- All plugins now available (no restrictions from github-pages gem)
- Same deployment target (GitHub Pages), different build method (GitHub Actions)
- Domain (www.viney.ca) and CNAME unchanged
- Google Analytics tracking preserved (G-GTFG819MNS)
