## Principles of Test Engineering?
The principles of test engineering are a set of fundamental concepts and guidelines that guide the design, development, and execution of tests. These principles include:

1. Early testing: Testing should start as early as possible in the software development life cycle to catch defects early and reduce the cost of fixing them.

2. Test automation: Test automation is essential for efficient and practical testing. Automated tests execute quickly and repeatedly, saving time and effort.

3. Test coverage: Test coverage should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the software, including functionality, performance, security, and usability.

4. Traceability: Test cases should be traceable to requirements and design artifacts to ensure all requirements are tested and defects are traced back to their source.

5. Continuous improvement: Test engineering should improve the testing process by learning from past experiences, adopting new techniques and technologies, and incorporating stakeholder feedback.

6. Risk-based testing: Testing should be prioritized based on the risks associated with the software. High-risk areas should be tested more thoroughly than low-risk areas.

7. Collaboration: Test engineering should involve collaboration between testers, developers, and other stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned on the testing objectives and results.

By following these principles, test engineers can design and execute practical tests that ensure the quality of software products.

## Difference between Test Engineering and Quality Engineering?
Test engineering and quality engineering are both important roles in ensuring the quality of software products, but they have different focuses and responsibilities.

**Test engineering** is primarily concerned with **designing**, **developing**, and **executing test cases** to validate the **functionality**, **performance**, and **reliability** of software applications. Test engineers typically work closely with software developers to identify defects and ensure the software meets the requirements and specifications.

On the other hand, **quality engineering** is a broader role encompassing all aspects of ensuring the quality of software products. **Quality engineers** are responsible for **designing** and **implementing quality management systems**, **processes**, and **procedures** that help to **prevent defects** and ensure that the **software meets the needs of the customer**. Quality Engineering includes areas such as **requirements management**, **risk management**, **test planning**, **defect management**, and **process improvement**.

While test engineering focuses on the testing aspects of quality assurance, quality engineering takes a more holistic view of the entire software development life cycle. It considers how all aspects of the process contribute to the overall quality of the software product.

In summary, test engineering is a subset of quality engineering that focuses specifically on testing activities. In contrast, quality engineering encompasses a broader set of activities to ensure the software product's overall quality.
