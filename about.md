# About

## About This Blog

This blog distills two decades of software engineering and quality practice into actionable insights for practitioners and leaders. I focus on the decisions that matter: how to structure test strategies that actually improve delivery, when automation investments pay off, and how to communicate quality metrics that executives care about.

### Content Creation & AI Transparency

Some articles are generated using [economist-agents](https://github.com/oviney/economist-agents), a multi-agent AI system I built to produce content in The Economist's editorial style. This isn't automated blogging—it's a structured pipeline with human oversight at every stage:

**4 Review Checkpoints:**
1. Topic selection (AI proposes, I approve)
2. Research verification (AI gathers data, I fact-check)
3. Draft review (AI writes, I edit for accuracy and tone)
4. Publication approval (I manually commit and publish)

**Quality Standards:**
- All statistics are verified and cited
- Claims are fact-checked before publication
- Content matches established editorial voice
- Human editor has final approval on all content

The goal: maintain consistent quality and publishing cadence while ensuring accuracy and editorial integrity.

## About Me

I'm Ouray Viney, a quality engineering consultant with over 20 years of experience building and leading software quality functions. My work spans test strategy development, automation architecture, performance engineering, and team leadership across enterprise and startup environments.

**What I bring to engagements:**

- Practical experience designing test strategies that balance thoroughness with delivery speed
- Track record building automation frameworks that teams actually maintain
- Executive communication skills to translate technical quality metrics into business impact
- Commitment to sustainable practices—both in code and in engineering culture

I believe quality engineering is a strategic function, not just a testing cost center. Done well, it accelerates delivery, reduces operational risk, and builds engineering confidence.
