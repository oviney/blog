# Software Engineering

Software engineering applies systematic methods to software development. This page outlines core principles that distinguish sustainable engineering practice from ad-hoc coding.

## The Engineering Process

Software engineering follows a structured lifecycle, though the sequence and emphasis vary by methodology:

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Capture stakeholder needs, define scope, establish success criteria.
2. **Design:** Architect the solution, define interfaces, plan for scalability and security.
3. **Implementation:** Write code following established standards and patterns.
4. **Testing:** Verify functionality, performance, and security against requirements.
5. **Deployment:** Release to production with appropriate monitoring and rollback capabilities.
6. **Maintenance:** Address defects, performance issues, and evolving requirements.

## Core Principles

**Modularity:** Decompose systems into independent, testable components.

**Separation of Concerns:** Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between modules to enable independent evolution.

**High Cohesion:** Related functionality should be grouped together.

**Defensive Programming:** Anticipate failure modes and handle errors gracefully.

## Best Practices

**Version Control:** All code in source control. Meaningful commits. Branching strategy aligned with release cadence.

**Code Review:** Peer review before merge. Focus on correctness, maintainability, and knowledge sharing.

**Continuous Integration:** Automated build and test on every commit. Fast feedback loops.

**Documentation:** Document decisions, not just code. Architecture decision records (ADRs) capture context.

**Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations from requirements through deployment.
