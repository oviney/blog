# Editorial Review: Quality Metrics Executives Actually Use

1. **Unattributed Statistics**: "Only 22% of companies use defect escape rate as a primary quality metric, a striking revelation from the ASQ Global State of Quality 4.0 report."

   - **Problem**: The 22% figure is mentioned without direct sourcing within the text. Even though the report is cited later in the references, proper attribution should be more immediate.
   - **Suggested Fix**: Add a footnote or parenthetical citation immediately following the statistic: "Only 22% of companies use defect escape rate as a primary quality metric (ASQ Global State of Quality 4.0 report)."

2. **Cliché Phrase**: "mounting poor quality costs."

   - **Problem**: The phrase is a tired cliché that oversimplifies the issue.
   - **Suggested Fix**: Use more precise language: "increasing financial burden due to quality inefficiencies."

3. **Logic Gap**: "metrics significantly influence budgeting decisions, yet a considerable portion remains ignored or misaligned with executive strategies."

   - **Problem**: This sentence doesn’t clearly explain the relationship between metrics influencing budget decisions and being ignored or misaligned.
   - **Suggested Fix**: Clarify the correlation: "While metrics are intended to influence budget decisions, many remain ignored or misaligned with executive strategies, resulting in a dissonance between data collection and its intended application."

4. **Voice Break**: "The allure of flashy numbers often obscures more nuanced, yet vital, measures such as defect escape rates and cost of quality."

   - **Problem**: The term "flashy numbers" is informal and not in line with The Economist's usual tone.
   - **Suggested Fix**: Replace with: "The emphasis on visibly impressive figures often detracts from the more substantial, yet essential, metrics such as defect escape rates and cost of quality."

5. **Missing Contrarian View**: The article largely assumes that defect escape rates and similar metrics are universally beneficial without exploring potential downsides or limitations.

   - **Problem**: Conventional wisdom is echoed without examination of potential challenges or alternative viewpoints regarding the use of complex metrics.
   - **Suggested Fix**: Introduce a section discussing possible limitations or challenges in implementing defect escape rate tracking, such as cultural resistance or the difficulty of accurately capturing data.

Overall, while the article presents a compelling argument for the use of quality metrics, it suffers from a reliance on conventional wisdom without a comprehensive consideration of alternative perspectives or potential challenges in implementation.
