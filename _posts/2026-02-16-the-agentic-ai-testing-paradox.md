According to a recent study, benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of about twelvefold relative to the original CPU implementation on a single GPU. This impressive acceleration, achieved with GPU technology, exemplifies the potentials and complexities of contemporary agentic AI systems. As organisations aggressively integrate these technologies, with 75% employing AI to bolster productivity, they face a dichotomy between reportedly inflated productivity gains and burgeoning maintenance costs.

## The Promised Productivity

The allure of AI is undeniable. McKinsey & Company reports that in 2025, three-quarters of organisations were embedding AI to enhance productivity, expecting transformative outcomes. Such optimism stems from AI's capacity to automate mundane tasks, discover insights from vast datasets, and optimize operational efficiencies previously untenable for human management alone.

However, these expectations often collide with stark realities. According to a study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review, initial projections of AI-driven productivity often exaggerate outcomes by nearly 40%. This palpable overestimation creates a conundrum for enterprises: on the one hand, they are driven by a promise of unprecedented efficiency gains, while on the other, the practical execution and tangible returns of AI initiatives fall short of the forecasts.

## The Hidden Costs

Alongside the productivity paradox, the economic implications of deploying agentic AI systems cannot be ignored. Gartner's analysis highlights that maintenance costs for AI now consume approximately 23% of total IT budgets. This reflects not only the resource-intensive nature of maintaining AI operations but also the need for ongoing updates, training sessions, and the management of unforeseen issues that arise post-deployment.

As the chart shows, while AI adoption is high, the overestimation of productivity gains underscores a significant disconnect between expected and actual outcomes. Such financial burdens, coupled with inflated productivity claims, suggest a reevaluation of how AI is marketed and implemented might be necessary.

## Technical Feats and Challenges

Agentic AI technologies hold the promise of better performance through technical advancements. For instance, GPU implementations are revolutionising AI's computational efficiency. The study by Motta et al. illustrates a substantial speedup in processing, mitigating some previous computational bottlenecks. Yet, this technological leap introduces fresh challenges, particularly in managing resource demands such as register pressure on processors.

Furthermore, modern large language models (LLMs) have advanced to the point of approaching the entropy rate of printed English — a benchmark predicting the efficiency of processing human language. While these milestones mark significant achievements in AI capability, the path to their real-world application is fraught with complexity and requires careful consideration and management.

## The Future of AI Testing

The paradox of agentic AI testing lies in balancing innovation with realistic assessments and applications. Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable AI systems to grasp context beyond text, making nuanced inferences across varied environments. This capability lays the groundwork for AI systems that can interact more fluidly within human domains, yet the transition from potential to practical application requires rigorous testing and contextual tuning.

Video Language Models emphasize understanding temporal dynamics, offering a glimpse into AI's rapid comprehension of change and sequence in real-time situations. These advancements suggest a future where AI can not only meet but exceed human-like understanding and response times. Nonetheless, these systems will necessitate continuous evaluation to refine their abilities and integrate them seamlessly into existing workflows.

Agentic AI is not an ultimate fix but a tool that, when harnessed judiciously, offers transformative potential. Its adoption must be tempered with realistic expectations of improvements versus costs. As AI technologies mature, organisations that focus on detailed, transparent evaluations and adjust both strategies and budgets will harness AI's full potential, avoiding the pitfalls of its accompanying paradoxes.
