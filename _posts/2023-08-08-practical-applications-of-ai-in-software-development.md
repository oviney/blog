Generative AI tools are changing how developers write code. This post examines where AI assistance adds genuine value and where it requires careful oversight.

## High-Value Use Cases

**Code Generation:** AI excels at boilerplate—generating test scaffolding, data models, API clients. Time saved on repetitive tasks can be redirected to complex problem-solving.

**Code Explanation:** Legacy codebases become more accessible when AI can summarize function behavior and identify patterns.

**Test Case Generation:** AI can suggest edge cases and generate initial test structures, accelerating test coverage expansion.

**Documentation Drafting:** First drafts of technical documentation, API descriptions, and code comments.

## Areas Requiring Caution

**Security-Critical Code:** AI-generated code may contain vulnerabilities. Authentication, authorization, and data handling require human review.

**Complex Business Logic:** AI lacks domain context. Business rules and edge cases need human judgment.

**Architectural Decisions:** AI can implement patterns but shouldn't drive design choices that have long-term implications.

## Adoption Guidelines

1. Treat AI output as a first draft requiring review, not production-ready code.
2. Establish code review standards that specifically address AI-generated contributions.
3. Track productivity metrics before and after AI tool adoption to measure actual impact.
4. Train teams on effective prompting to maximize AI utility.

## The Bottom Line

AI tools amplify developer capability but don't replace engineering judgment. The most effective adoption treats AI as a productivity multiplier for well-understood tasks while maintaining human oversight for decisions that matter.
