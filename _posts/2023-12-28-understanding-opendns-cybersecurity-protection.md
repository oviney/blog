OpenDNS, now part of Cisco Umbrella, is known for effectively addressing several major security issues. It primarily functions as a cloud-delivered network security service that intercepts and analyzes internet requests to prevent cyber threats. Below is a summary of how OpenDNS tackles major security issues:
<!--more-->

### Malware Protection
- **Mechanism:** OpenDNS maintains a constantly updated database of malicious internet destinations. When a user attempts to access a website, OpenDNS checks if the site is known for hosting malware.
- **Effectiveness:** By preventing connections to malicious sites, it stops malware from being downloaded and can even disrupt communication between an infected device and its command-and-control center.

### Phishing Attack Prevention
- **Mechanism:** OpenDNS identifies and blocks known phishing sites. These fraudulent sites mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive information like login credentials and credit card numbers.
- **Effectiveness:** By blocking access to these deceptive sites, OpenDNS significantly reduces the risk of users inadvertently disclosing personal information.

### Botnet Mitigation
- **Mechanism:** OpenDNS detects and blocks traffic to and from botnet command-and-control servers. Botnets are networks of compromised computers controlled by attackers.
- **Effectiveness:** This interruption in communication prevents botnets from executing coordinated attacks and stops the spread of botnet infections.

### Content Filtering
- **Mechanism:** OpenDNS allows users to block access to specific types of websites, such as those hosting adult content or promoting violence.
- **Effectiveness:** Content filtering helps maintain a safe and productive online environment, particularly in schools and homes.

### DNS-Based Security
- **Mechanism:** Since OpenDNS operates at the DNS (Domain Name System) level, it can enforce security measures without installing software on individual devices.
- **Effectiveness:** This approach provides a blanket layer of protection for all devices on the network, including IoT devices that are often hard to secure.

### Zero-Day Attack Protection
- **Mechanism:** OpenDNS uses predictive intelligence to identify and block threats that are not yet widely known (zero-day attacks).
- **Effectiveness:** By analyzing patterns and anomalies in internet traffic, OpenDNS can prevent attacks even before they are officially identified and documented.

### Data Loss Prevention
- **Mechanism:** By monitoring and controlling data transmissions, OpenDNS can help prevent sensitive data from being transmitted to unauthorized destinations.
- **Effectiveness:** This is crucial for businesses and organizations handling sensitive information, helping them comply with various data protection regulations.
